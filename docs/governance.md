## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you'll be able to:
- Implement syntactic and semantic evaluation for AI agents
- Set up monitoring and tracing for agent performance
- Build RAG evaluation systems using the RAG Triad methodology
- Create governance frameworks for AI agent deployment
- Visualize agent performance metrics and traces
- Establish responsible AI practices for production systems

## Why AI Governance Matters

AI governance is critical for:
- **Trust and reliability** in AI systems
- **Regulatory compliance** with AI regulations
- **Risk mitigation** for business operations
- **Performance optimization** through continuous monitoring
- **Ethical AI deployment** with bias detection and mitigation
- **Transparency and explainability** for stakeholders


## Evaluation Framework

### 1. Syntactic Evaluation (`1. syntactic.py`)

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://www.linkedin.com/embed/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:7351866408395264000?compact=1" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="Tool Syntactic Accuracy"></iframe></div>

**Objective**: Evaluate basic agent functionality and response consistency

**What you'll learn**:
- Basic response evaluation metrics
- Consistency testing across similar queries
- Response format validation

**Test prompts for evaluation**:
1. `"What's Google's stock price?"`
2. `"What's IBM's stock price?"`

**Key concepts**:
- **Response consistency**: Similar queries should produce similar response structures
- **Format validation**: Ensure responses meet expected formats
- **Basic functionality**: Verify core agent capabilities work reliably

### 2. RAG Triad Evaluation (`2. ragtriad.py`)

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://www.linkedin.com/embed/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:7353928857927802880?compact=1" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="RAG Triad"></iframe></div>

**Objective**: Comprehensive evaluation of RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) systems

**What you'll learn**:
- **Context Relevance**: How relevant is the retrieved context?
- **Groundedness**: How well does the answer stay grounded in the context?
- **Answer Relevance**: How relevant is the answer to the original question?

**The RAG Triad Framework**:
```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│ Context         │    │ Groundedness    │    │ Answer          │
│ Relevance       │◄──►│ Evaluation      │◄──►│ Relevance       │
│                 │    │                 │    │                 │
└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
      ▲                         ▲                         ▲
      │                         │                         │
   Query ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────► Response
```

**Test prompts for evaluation**:
1. `"What's the limit on overseas assistance?"`
2. `"What is the definition of epidemic?"`

**Evaluation metrics**:
- **Context Relevance Score**: 0.0 - 1.0 (higher is better)
- **Groundedness Score**: 0.0 - 1.0 (higher is better)  
- **Answer Relevance Score**: 0.0 - 1.0 (higher is better)

### 3. Visualization and Monitoring (`3. plotlychart.py`)

**Objective**: Create interactive dashboards for monitoring agent performance

**What you'll learn**:
- Performance metrics visualization
- Real-time monitoring dashboards
- Trace analysis and debugging
- Historical performance trends

**Generated outputs**:
- `graph.png`: Performance metrics visualization
- `rag_graph.png`: RAG-specific evaluation charts
- Interactive Plotly dashboards

## Key Governance Concepts

### Evaluation Metrics

#### Response Quality
- **Accuracy**: Factual correctness of responses
- **Relevance**: How well the response addresses the query
- **Completeness**: Whether the response fully answers the question
- **Clarity**: How understandable the response is

#### System Performance
- **Response Time**: How quickly the agent responds
- **Throughput**: How many queries can be handled per minute
- **Availability**: System uptime and reliability
- **Cost**: Resource consumption per query

#### Safety and Ethics
- **Bias Detection**: Identifying unfair or discriminatory responses
- **Toxicity Screening**: Filtering harmful content
- **Privacy Compliance**: Protecting user data
- **Hallucination Detection**: Identifying false or fabricated information

### Monitoring and Tracing

#### Trace Data Structure
```json
{
  "trace_id": "uuid",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-08T10:30:00Z",
  "query": "User question",
  "response": "Agent response",
  "context": ["Retrieved documents"],
  "metrics": {
    "context_relevance": 0.85,
    "groundedness": 0.92,
    "answer_relevance": 0.88,
    "response_time_ms": 1500
  }
}
```

#### Trace Storage
Traces are stored in:
- `trace.json`: Individual trace files
- `wxgov_traces/`: Directory with experiment traces
- ChromaDB: Vector database for similarity search

### Governance Framework

#### 1. Pre-deployment Evaluation
- Comprehensive testing across diverse scenarios
- Bias and fairness assessment
- Performance benchmarking
- Safety validation

#### 2. Production Monitoring
- Real-time performance tracking
- Anomaly detection
- User feedback collection
- Continuous evaluation

#### 3. Post-deployment Analysis
- Performance trend analysis
- Issue investigation and resolution
- Model improvement recommendations
- Compliance reporting

## Governance Best Practices

### 1. Evaluation Strategy
- **Multi-dimensional evaluation**: Don't rely on a single metric
- **Human-in-the-loop**: Combine automated and human evaluation
- **Continuous testing**: Regular evaluation, not just pre-deployment
- **Diverse test cases**: Cover edge cases and various scenarios

### 2. Monitoring Implementation
- **Real-time alerts**: Set up alerts for performance degradation
- **Baseline establishment**: Define normal performance ranges
- **Trend analysis**: Look for gradual performance changes
- **User feedback integration**: Collect and analyze user satisfaction

### 3. Compliance and Ethics
- **Documentation**: Maintain detailed records of evaluations
- **Audit trails**: Track all changes and decisions
- **Bias testing**: Regularly test for unfair outcomes
- **Privacy protection**: Ensure user data is handled appropriately

### 4. Incident Response
- **Escalation procedures**: Clear steps when issues are detected
- **Rollback capabilities**: Ability to revert to previous versions
- **Root cause analysis**: Investigate and learn from failures
- **Communication plans**: Keep stakeholders informed during incidents
